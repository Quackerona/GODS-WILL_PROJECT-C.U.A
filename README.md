## Project C.U.A is an engine for Friday Night Funkin', but completely rewritten in the Godot game engine.

Project C.U.A isn't limited by Haxeflixel's capabilities, as the Godot game engine allows alot more flexibilities and functionalities.
(DISCLAIMER: This specific version of "Project C.U.A" is very barebone as it was made specifically for "GOD'S WILL"!)

### Requirements:
- Dependencies to get C# working.
- Git LFS (To clone this repo).
- Godot Engine (.NET) >= 4.2.2
- Json.net Newtonsoft.
